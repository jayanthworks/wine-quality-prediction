Prediction of wine quality "good" or "bad" based on several wine compositions

In order to learn more about how wine quality and wine chemical properties are related, we are using a dataset that initially was created for a research paper by Paulo Cortez, Antonio Cerdeira, Fernando Almeida, Telmo Matos, and Jose and republished by Elsevierback in November 2009. This dataset is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009/version/2It.

We had two main goals:

Predict whether new wines have high or low quality.
Understand which chemical properties effect quality the most and identify whether higher or lower levels of those properties are more desirable.

Performed exploratory analysis and cleaned the data (removed outliers and null values)

Applied Linear regression,Support vector machine,Logistic regression,decision trees & random forest to classify "high" quality and "Low" quality wine.
